- **Contact Management:** Add, view, edit, and delete contact information.
- **Linking Clients and Contacts:** Link clients to contacts and view all linked relationships in both directions.
- **Dynamic UI with React:** Seamless navigation and real-time updates.
- **RESTful API:** Built with Express to handle CRUD operations and client-contact relationships.

   mysql -u yourUsername -p client_contact_db < /path/to/schema.sql
   ```

3. **Configure the Database Connection:**
   In the `/server/config.js` file, configure your MySQL connection:
   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     host: 'localhost',
     user: 'yourUsername',
     password: 'yourPassword',
     database: 'client_contact_db'
   };
   ```
